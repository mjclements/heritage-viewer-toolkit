<div class="story-title">Family Meeting Room</div>
<p>The interesting moment is for our families when they were coming to visit us. There were no cars at the time for families, for individual persons, but they needed to come to here, to Reps, actually. And from that point to here they had to walk because no one would drive them up to here because they were considered the families of enemies of the people so they were convicted as well.
</p><p>
They would regularly bring us food and thank God they did because that was the food that kept us alive. The food from the prison was very, very little so that was the food that kept us alive.
</p><p>
Police would dig into what you brought here. A lot of the time, if you brought bread, the officer would tear it apart just to make sure that there was nothing inside the bread that could be used to escape. The same thing would happen with sweets.
</p><p>
Sometimes you would come across a very dishonest person who would, for instance, combine sugar and rice just. There have been cases where they combined pasta and rice, but in this situation you could still get the pasta back and the rice back. But with rice and sugar how can you know? So this is just out of evil, basically.
</p><p>
Prisoner and families would enter the meeting area from different sides. There were two metallic fences, one for the prisoner and one for the relatives. This double system of fences was created so that people couldn’t embrace or touch each other. They could just barely touch the tips of their fingers. You have to imagine how hard it was for a mother or someone’s child to travel here and have a meeting for 10 minutes and be able to only touch fingers with the loved ones.
</p><p>
Sometimes you would fall in with a police officer who was a bit more kind who would open a door so you could embrace your relative but that was very, very rare.
</p><p>
The control of these meetings was so important that a police man would stay here while you were talking to your relative and you would only be aloud to talk about family matters. Nothing else. And the police man would be very intensively looking at your lips or if you kind of wanted to say something that shouldn’t be said so to that level of control it was intense.
