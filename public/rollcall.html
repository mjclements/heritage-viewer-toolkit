	They'd say things like: "There is no opportunity for you to escape, or become normal again, for we will not allow it. If you have hopes for your Anglo-American friends to come and save you, as soon as they land in Durres, we will call you all up here at the rollcall area, and shoot everyone. Then we will go and fight them."</p><p>
	"The roll call would happen twice a day. In the morning it would be at 9 AM, per the regulations, and the afternoon would be a 5 PM. The problem was that they would be called up to the terrace, but the responsible administration would not come until one or two hours later to dispatch them to work. They would wait for one or two hours in the cold or the heat, with no option to react. The worst was for the prisoners who worked the third shift, who would end their shift at 8 AM. They would have to come here to get counted, so they would come here at 8, and then wait an additional two or three hours to get counted. Then, they would go back and sleep only a few hours.</p><p>
	These were the rules they were exposed to that were outside the regulations.
