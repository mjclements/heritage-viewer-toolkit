<p>At one point there was volleyball and they would be allowed to play sometimes, but this place was known as a dangerous place. They would be called up by the administration and everyone would line up here. Whenever that would happen something bad would happen. They knew that because the policemen would be over there pointing guns at them from the terrace and the investigation unit from Reps would come. They would come among the people here and catch the person that they needed to bring back with them. That was a very important moment, because you never knew who would be taken away. It could be you, it could be a close friend of yours. You never knew, so it was an important moment.
</p><p>
There was a moment when they were called up here and the police took someone who was charged for high treason against the state of Albania while in prison. You can imagine how he could commit high treason here. And he was courageous enough to shout here in the middle of everyone “Down with the spies and down with the people who are playing with the spies!”
