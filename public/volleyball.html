<p>They gathered us in the field. Others, from the central committee had come from the prison headquarters. One of the delegates spoke to us. He was talking about the economy, and how we were the “happiest country in the world,“  a democratic place with a standard of living that no other country had. He talked and talked but no one was actually listening. After he finished his speech he asked if we had any questions. No one had any questions. He insisted on questions from people that were well formed intellectually, because in the camp there were people that knew at least 5 languages. This was very common for the people that were inside the prison. One man from Korça stood up and wanted to ask a question . He asked if there were any consequences for asking a question, and if he could get an answer. The officer said “Sure. There are no consequences and you will get your answer.”
</p><p>The officer said “I’m a very important person, and I know the global politics very well and I have finished Tirana University.” Tirana University had just been created, but he was praising himself as if he had been to Cambridge University.
</p><p>The prisoner’s question was very simple. "Does everything that is born die?”
</p><p>“Yes, because it is nature’s law”
</p><p>“Then when will communism in Albania die?”
</p><p>There wasn’t any answer, and I never saw that person ever again. The officer didn’t keep his word.</p>
