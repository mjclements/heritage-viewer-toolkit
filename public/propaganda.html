<p>This goal of dehumanizing prisoners was very clear in the propaganda because outside they were trumpeting that in places like Spaç or internment camps they would put men who didn’t have any of the values of the “new” man that Communism wanted to build. Therefore they were not only isolated but also helping to build a better country by working as slaves. That was something very hard for them to endure here. They were working here but their contribution was not recognized by anyone inside or outside of the prison.</p>
<p>
The philosophy of the slogans that you can see here and there. So, yeah, these are sayings in relation to the values of Marxism. Quotes form the dictator were supposedly sentences and phrases that would help the prisoner’s rehabilitation.

The quote on the left said “By stealing, evildoers attack our regime and our Economic Socialist base.” It is attributed to Enver Hoxha.
