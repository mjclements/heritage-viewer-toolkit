      "story_content":"<p>According to Zenel, there were 54 people sharing this room. On this side of the room you had 10 beds and 3 levels so 30 people would sleep on one wall. And then you had an additional 6 beds here multiplied by 3 three levels. So 18 persons plus 30 is 48. And then here there were double beds with 3 levels so it’s 6 additional persons. So 54 total persons.</p><p>It was possible because there was only 60 cm of width, so you would need to sleep on your side, otherwise you would end up touching another person. </p><p>Depending on where you were, like 1st, 2nd, 3rd level, there would be different smells. Because you can imagine that many persons after having worked all day, you can imagine a bit how it would have smelled.</p><p>In the morning, there was a courier who would go around and tell everyone to get up. This person would go around at 5:00. Zenel says he created this habit of walking up a bit early, at about 4:45 to be able to go with a bit more comfort to the toilets to clean himself before he had to go to work. Because if you wake up later, he said, then you will be like with 300 other people waiting in line to get access to the toilets, where there were 10 water taps and 15 toilets where you could go in the morning. </p>",

      "story_content":"<<p>Zenel’s brother knew this person who had a truck to transfer minerals, and he asked this person if he could bring the brother, mother, and about 30 kilos of food up to Spac. We are talking about the wintertime; it’s New Year’s Eve. The guy said no because he had orders not to. The brother and mother started walking. The brother wound up carrying the mother and 30 kilos up the road for a meeting with Zenel that lasted 10 minutes. And then, once they were back on the road, they ran into the same person and he offered to take them down.</p><p>The brother said no because he didn’t offer to bring them up when they had all of the food. Now that they were relatively light they could walk down on their own. </p><p>He said “No, we won’t go with you because you didn’t take us the first time.” </p><p>But Zenel’s mother started to insist “Please, let’s do this, let’s go with this person and save ourselves a bit of trouble.”</p><p>The brother insisted, “No, we won’t go with him”</p><p>And this truck went by and continued down the road, a second truck came along. The brother knew this driver as well and decided to go with him. They reached a point here in the valley where there is a very narrow spot in the road and the first truck, the one that didn’t take them, actually crossed with another truck that was going uphill.</p><p>In these situations, the rule was that you let people going uphill pass first and then you would pass. The driver of the first truck started to do this and then something fatal happened. The truck fell down into the river and the guy was killed instantly.</p><p>One can imagine how lucky they felt at the time.</p>",

Therefore they were not only isolated but also helping to build a better country by working as slaves. That was something very hard for them to endure here. They were working here but their contribution was not recognized by anyone inside or outside of the prison.</p><p>The philosophy of the slogans that you can see here and there. So, yeah, these are sayings in relation to the values of Marxism. Quotes form the dictator were supposedly sentences and phrases that would help the prisoner’s rehabilitation.</p><p>The quote on the left said “By stealing, evildoers attack our regime and our Economic Socialist base.” It is attributed to Enver Hoxha.</p>",

They would be called up by the administration and everyone would line up here. Whenever that would happen something bad would happen. They knew that because the policemen would be over there pointing guns at them from the terrace and the investigation unit from Reps would come. They would come among the people here and catch the person that they needed to bring back with them. That was a very important moment, because you never knew who would be taken away. It could be you, it could be a close friend of yours. You never knew, so it was an important moment.</p><p>There was a moment when they were called up here and the police took someone who was charged for high treason against the state of Albania while in prison. You can imagine how he could commit high treason here. And he was courageous enough to shout here in the middle of everyone “Down with the spies and down with the people who are playing with the spies!” </p>",

      "story_content":"<p>The interesting moment is for our families when they were coming to visit us. There were no cars at the time for families, for individual persons, but they needed to come to here, to Reps, actually. And from that point to here they had to walk because no one would drive them up to here because they were considered the families of enemies of the people so they were convicted as well.</p><p>They would regularly bring us food and thank God they did because that was the food that kept us alive. The food from the prison was very, very little so that was the food that kept us alive.</p><p>Police would dig into what you brought here. A lot of the time, if you brought bread, the officer would tear it apart just to make sure that there was nothing inside the bread that could be used to escape. The same thing would happen with sweets.</p><p>Sometimes you would come across a very dishonest person who would, for instance, combine sugar and rice just. There have been cases where they combined pasta and rice, but in this situation you could still get the pasta back and the rice back. But with rice and sugar how can you know? So this is just out of evil, basically.</p><p>Prisoner and families would enter the meeting area from different sides. There were two metallic fences, one for the prisoner and one for the relatives. This double system of fences was created so that people couldn’t embrace or touch each other. They could just barely touch the tips of their fingers. You have to imagine how hard it was for a mother or someone’s child to travel here and have a meeting for 10 minutes and be able to only touch fingers with the loved ones.</p><p>Sometimes you would fall in with a police officer who was a bit more kind who would open a door so you could embrace your relative but that was very, very rare.</p><p>The control of these meetings was so important that a police man would stay here while you were talking to your relative and you would only be aloud to talk about family matters. Nothing else. And the police man would be very intensively looking at your lips or if you kind of wanted to say something that shouldn’t be said so to that level of control it was intense.</p></p>",

This was very common for the people that were inside the prison. One man from Korça stood up and wanted to ask a question . He asked if there were any consequences for asking a question, and if he could get an answer. The officer said \"Sure.

The small gate was the first that you could pass through when a friend was beeing realised.until then we had the right to accompany him and then we splited. As he passed through the gate he seemed another person , it was free still without coming out the big gate of the camp . For us the small gate was more important than the big gate of camp entry. The big metallic gate we see it from the distance. Although it was the first or the last door with chains ( the first when you came in and the last when you came out ), for us it had more the power of an symbol. That we disdained. That we could even ignore. But the small door no. This was our door as it was of the police. Because this didn't had any locker's. This was without a chain , without a key.</p><p>If you past through that gate you could get killed, but that wasn't important , the important thing was that it wasn't closed.</p><p>That was the small gate of the hell .</p><p>All my life I have tried to picture the hell's gate and it was here in camp.
